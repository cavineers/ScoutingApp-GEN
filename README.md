# ScoutingApp Gen
Generic Code template for Scouting app


## Prerequisites

## for apple users
to install and store the Pypi packages, you need to download miniconda
- [`miniconda`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/)
NOTE: if you're on an apple M1 computer, download `Miniconda3 macOS Apple M1 64-bit bash` and if you're not, download `Miniconda3 macOS Intel x86 64-bit bash`

1. open up your terminal
   - search: F4 > terminal
2. use the following in order (case sensitive)
   - `cd downloads`
   - `ls -l`
   - then go and find where your miniconda install is located EX: Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh
   - `./Miniconda-latest(filename)`
        - If you don't have permissions to download it, do the command `chmod +x ./Minicondaâ€¦`
   - read through the user agreement, READ IT, and THEN type `yes` in the terminal
   - `eval "(/Users/(name)/miniconda3/bin/conda shell.(name) hook)"`
   - `conda init`
3. install and initialize the pypi packages by making a conda environment in VSCode
   - now that ypu've initialized the download for miniconda, move into VSCode and open a new terminal (ctrl + shift + `)
   - `conda create -n (environment name) python=3.11` we are using python 3.11.3, so be sure to state what python version we're using
   - `conda activate (environment name)` this should've moved you into the environment you've created
4. below this are all of the pypi packages you will need to download, install all of them with the Linux/Apple command (`python3 -m pip install --upgrade Flask google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib waitress`). after you've done that, run the app using `python3 main.py`.
5. after that go into any browser and type `localhost:80` and thats it

if the app gives you an error about a token being missing when you run the python3 command, that means you dont have the apikeys.json file or api token. follow from step 2 to 2b to get that problem resolved. 

(hey, this is max. for now (as in as im still on the team) don't generate a new token. If you need the token just @ me on the discord or in dm's and ill give it to you. if you do end up generating a token, PLEASE send it to me so I can share it to others. if you're not on the discord or know me on discord at all, email me at `maxmaginnis@yahoo.com`. thanks for the cooperation.)
   

### Pypi Packages
- [`Flask`](https://pypi.org/project/Flask)
- [`google-api-python-client`](https://pypi.org/project/google-api-python-client)
- [`google-auth-httplib2`](https://pypi.org/project/google-auth-httplib2)
- [`google-auth-oauthlib`](https://pypi.org/project/google-auth-oauthlib)
- [`waitress`](https://pypi.org/project/waitress)

Install With
- Windows:  &emsp;`py -m pip install --upgrade Flask google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib waitress`
- Linux/Apple: &emsp;`python3 -m pip install --upgrade Flask google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib waitress`

## Setup for Windows & Linux
1. ### Pull repository
   `git pull https://github.com/cavineers/ScoutingApp-GEN`
2. ### Set up Google Sheets API and Credentials
   Follow (most of) this tutorial to help get everything set up: https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python

   2a. Setup OAuth for your Google Cloud Project and put the generated JSON in in file `ScoutingApp-GEN/token.json`

      Diagram:
      ```
      {
         "Sheets OAuth": ...
      }
      ```
      - Sheets OAuth
          - The OAuth JSON generated by Google Cloud
          - type: `dict[str, str]`

   2b. During first runtime, click the OAuth concent link printed to the console
      - If you already did so and have generated the `ScoutingApp-GEN/token.json` file, this file can be moved into other instances of the app to use the same token.
      - Note: The token will eventually expire, so the `token.json` file must be deleted and regenerated with the OAuth concent link, and any copies must be replaced with the new token.

## Run
The following commands must be ran in the repository directory.

<br>

### Quickrun
Quickly run the flask app on `0.0.0.0:80` with
- Windows:  &emsp;`py main.py`
- Linux/Apple: &emsp;`python3 main.py`

### Specify host IP and port
Specify IP and port to host with
- Windows:  &emsp;`py -m ScoutingApp.__main host=<ip> port=<port>`
- Linux/Apple: &emsp;`python3 -m ScoutingApp.__main host=<ip> port=<port>`
